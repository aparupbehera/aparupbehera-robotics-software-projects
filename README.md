1. Create a Gazebo World - Simulating a robotic environment with Gazebo

2. ROS Essentials - Write ROS Nodes of your own in C++.

3. Localization - Using Gaussian filters to estimate noisy sensor readings, and how to estimate a robotâ€™s position relative to a known map of the environment with Monte Carlo Localization (MCL).

4. Mapping and SLAM - Creating a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementation with ROS packages and C++ and combining mapping algorithms

5. Path Planning and Navigation - Combining SLAM and Navigation into a home service robot that can autonomously transport objects in your home!
